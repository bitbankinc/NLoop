            If the fee estimate is lower, we publish the sweep tx.
            If the sweep tx is not confirmed, we are forced to ratchet up fees until it is swept.
            Possibly even exceeding max_miner_fee if we get close to the HTLC timeout.
            Because the initial publication revealed the preimage, we have no other choice.
            The server may already have pulled the off-chain HTLC. Only when the fee becomes higher than
            the swap amount, we can wait for fees to come down and hope -- if we are past the timeout -- that
            the server is not publishing the revocation.
